**Volcanic JavaScript technical test**

In this test the applicant is required to fulfill the following requirements:

---

## Set up

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include any Js chart generator library of your choice.

## Requirements

## Step 1
1. For this test you will be required to restructure the JSON data provided in index.js to be used to create a pieChart that outlines the sum of different **event types**.

2. The pieChart should look similar to this image:

## Step 2

1. Based on what you've created for step 1, dynamically generate a pieChart for each one of the event types, and display the weight of every **event key**.

## Step 3

1. Based on what you've done for step 2, Create a bubble Chart to show the impact of events based on the **event value** of every **event type** and show the weight of each value.

2. You can use the weight of values for the radius.

3. The biggest circle should be at the center on the X and Y axis.

4. The bigger the circle the closer it is to the center and the smaller it gets, the further it needs to be.

5. Other than the biggest circle you can set the position of the other circles at random ( above ,below, right or left to the main big circle ) as long as you follow the rules above.

6. The intention here is the presentation of the data.
